    description: `Poly always wanted to develop her social skills, especially knowing that she is autistic and struggles the most in that area. She started 
    streaming in 2018 and fell in love with the way it allows for active discussions and the establishment of a direct connection with supporters.
    Although she started out as a speedrunner, Poly is transitioning into a variety streamer and often streams with her partners Taiga and Dan. She works hard to  
    constantly improve her communication skills, knowledge of streaming tools, and media production quality while fostering an open-minded and passionate 
    community.`,

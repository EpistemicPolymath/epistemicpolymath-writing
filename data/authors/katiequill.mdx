Katie Quill has been writing professionally for several years now and is eager to branch out into other forms of short fiction and nonfiction. She has way too mny thoughts about the state of media today and needs an outlet or her friends and family are going to stage an intervention. She enjoys reading old fairy tales, heartfelt manga, and books about the creative process. Horror keeps her up at night but is one of her favorite things in the world.

Specializing in speculative fiction - fantasy, science fiction, and horror - Katie has spent several years building up a reputation for fictional stories about trans folks, their struggles, and their accomplishments as she develops her skills, some of which have been included in group bundles with highly-regarded transgender writers in the online space.

Poly is a [Twitch streamer](https://www.twitch.tv/EpistemicPolymath), content creator (primarily on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EpistemicPolymath)), advocate for disabled and LGBTQ+ communities, and writer. Her passions include mental health, discussions on perspective and personal experiences, and individual growth and development. She's *obsessed* with life-long learning and in-depth study of various topics. Poly, fittingly, has many sides to her identity.

Her professional interests center on quality assurance and accessibility, with professional experience as a quality assurance engineer and accessibility testing/expertise.

Content-wise, Poly hopes to focus on creating an "empowered reality." She is critical of toxic positivity and the way it advocates that we ignore the human need for vulnerability and connection or the harsh realities of daily life. Poly instead hopes to focus on empowering those around her while emphasizing what's real and within our grasp for change, growth, and development. This looks different for everyone, and it's a continuous process, but it's an ideal worth creating a community around.

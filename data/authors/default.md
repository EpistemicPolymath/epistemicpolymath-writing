Poly is a Twitch Streamer, Content Creator, advocate for Disabled and LGBTQ+ Communities, and Writer. She is passionate about various topics, including mental health, perspective discussions, and personal growth and development. She is obsessed with life-long learning and focuses on learning as much as possible about various topics and sharing her findings with others. Poly has many sides, hence her online alias name, poly.

Her professional interests focus on Quality assurance and Accessibility. Poly has worked as a Quality Assurance Engineer and specializes in Accessibility Testing/Expertise.

Content-wise, Poly hopes to focus on the idea of an empowered reality. Instead of toxic positivity, where you are forcefully upbeat and ignore the human need for vulnerability, connection, and the harsh realities of life; instead Poly hopes to focus on empowering those around her while focusing on what's real and within our grasp for change, growth, and development. That looks different for everyone and is a continuous process.

I don’t like when people write fanfiction. Wait, let me back out of that noose. I like when people write stories based on media they enjoy. What I dislike is seeing people sit down to critique, analyse, or review a piece of media but fill their script with headcanon and things that would have “fixed” the problems it has. They’re writing fanfiction; when I was younger, these were called “fix-it” fics, though I haven’t heard that term in a while. Stories like this can be fun, but when injected into a critical essay, the actual qualities of the thing being analyzed often end up on the cutting room floor.

People really want to rehabilitate *Harry Potter*, is what I’m saying.

But I think I can fix *Poppy Playtime*. I see the vision, I understand how the pieces work together, I have transcended the role of critic and become fangirl. So pretend I’ve strapped you to a chair in my basement in front of a chalkboard, because I need to tell someone all my thoughts about this series. You can’t leave; you’re on the honor system. I also soundproofed the walls and told everyone you were taking a personal day.

# How Did We Get Here, In My Basement, Anyway?
